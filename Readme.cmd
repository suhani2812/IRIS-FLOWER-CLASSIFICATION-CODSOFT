IRIS-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of three possible values: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

iris.csv: The dataset used in this project. iris_classification.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains the code for data exploration, data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. requirements.txt: A file that lists all the required dependencies to run the code in the Jupyter notebook.

Getting Started
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can follow these steps to get started: Clone this repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory. Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda. Activate the virtual environment. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Open the iris_classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, select and train a model, and evaluate the model's performance.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages: pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn You can install all the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
